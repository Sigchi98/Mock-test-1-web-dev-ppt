CSS positions:
a. Static:
The static position is the default position for HTML elements. It follows the normal flow of the document and doesn't require any additional positioning properties
Example: 
.static-example {
  position: static;
}
b. Fixed:
The fixed position is used to position an element relative to the browser window. The element stays fixed even when the page is scrolled.
Example:
.fixed-example {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
}
c. Sticky:
The sticky position behaves like a combination of relative and fixed. It remains in the document flow until a certain scroll threshold is reached, then it becomes fixed.
Example:
.sticky-example {
  position: sticky;
  top: 10px;
}
d. Relative:
The relative position positions an element relative to its normal position. It allows you to modify the element's position using properties like top, right, bottom, and left.
Example:
.relative-example {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
e. bsolute:
The absolute position positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor is found.
Example:
.absolute-example {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
We can modify the values of the positioning properties (e.g., top, right, bottom, left) to achieve the desired layout for your elements.
